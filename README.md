# Plumber_Optimizer
AI701 Project 
Group 15
This github includes our own impliminted technique for hyperparamter tuning, which we called the plumber optimizer.
In this repo we included the Plumber.py file which includes the code that runs our optimizer.
In additon we added 4 folders, in each of the folders we've included a datasets and an ipynb file in which we test the performance of our optimizer against three other traditonal hyperparamter tuning techniques.
